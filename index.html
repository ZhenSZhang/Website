<p1>What Do We Do?</p1>
<p>We are a Washington State non-profit group that shares current market, economics and finance knowledge to general public, especially college students, by means of public speech and study groups. Our goal is to promote general finance and market awareness, to equip general population, especially younger generation, with efficient knowledge to invest, and to prepare potential future stock market changes.</p>
</article>

<article>
<p1>Why?</p1>
<p>We believe that economy and finance are equally important as our day to day jobs. Many of our friends lost money with less to none knowledge of markets, lost houses during financial crisis, and had little saving/ investments despite great income. Money is one topic that we cannot hide from. With a little bit of understanding, one can make much better decision with money. Our goal is not to make money from investment, but to understand how money works in our lives, so that we can make better decisions to utilize it, for the pupose of serving our lives well.</p>
</article>

<article>
<p1>How?</p1>
<p>We believe in Share, Teach and Learn. We are posting knowledge and stories to share with public. We are holding free speeches to public with field experts to teach. We are planning physical and virtual meetups for us to learn.</p>
</article>

<p1>We believe knowledge of market and finance is as fundamental as reading and writing.</p1>
