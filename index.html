<p1>What Do We Do?</p1>
<p>We are a Washington State non-profit group that shares current market, economics and finance knowledge to general public, especially college students, by means of public speech and study groups. Our goal is to promote general finance and market awareness, to equip the general population, especially younger generations, with critical knowledge to invest, and prepare for future stock market changes.</p>
</article>

<article>
<p1>Why?</p1>
<p>We believe that the economy and finance are as important as our day to day jobs. Many of our friends lost money due to insufficient knowledge of markets, lost houses during financial crisis, and had little savings or investments despite high incomes. Money is one topic that we cannot hide from. With a little bit of understanding, one can make much better financial decisions. Our goal is not to make money from investment, but to understand how money works in our lives, so that we can make better decisions with it. This will let us use money to serve our lives, not live our lives to serve our bank accounts</p>
</article>

<article>
<p1>How?</p1>
<p>We believe in Share, Teach and Learn. We are posting knowledge and stories to share with the public. We hold free speeches open to the public with field experts to share knowledge. We are planning physical and virtual meetups for us to learn.</p>
</article>

<p1>We believe knowledge of markets and finance is as fundamental as reading and writing.</p1>
